# Welcome to Kids Mealz!

We know that parenting isn't always a walk in the park, especially when it comes to meal planning for your little ones. Kids have endless energy, big appetites, and let's face it, sometimes they can be pretty picky eaters. That's where Kids Mealz comes in! We built this platform with the mission to make meal planning for kids a breeze, and maybe even a bit fun.

# What's Cooking?

With Kids Mealz, you can dive into a trove of dishes you've added to your personal meal repertoire. Whether you're looking for the perfect breakfast to start off your child's day or a dinner dish they'll be excited to dig into, you can easily search and find what you're after.

That's not all. You can also add new meals to your collection, ready to be served up at a later date. And don't worry, we haven't forgotten about those meals that were a hit this week. You can easily keep track of meals your kids have already enjoyed, to either avoid a repeat or to take note of their new favorite dish.

And for those meals that aren't cutting it anymore, either due to a sudden lack of ingredients or a lack of interest from your resident food critics, our handy "All Gone" button lets you bid them farewell.

# Need Some Foodspiration?

If your recipe repertoire is starting to feel a bit stale, don't sweat it. The internet is your oyster. For a fresh splash of inspiration, Google is always there, or if you're in the mood to ride the wave of the latest food trends, Pinterest can be a treasure trove of ideas.

# What's Next on the Menu?

We're always looking to improve and expand the Kids Mealz experience. In the near future, we plan to add an edit feature to the dishes. This way, if a dish could do with a little tweak, you'll be able to alter the ingredients instead of having to whip up a whole new recipe.

# Behind the Kitchen Doors

Kids Mealz was lovingly built using JavaScript, React, and Create React App. As a single developer, I took charge of the frontend development, focusing on creating an experience that's intuitive and engaging for users. To give Kids Mealz its unique flavor, I put custom CSS to work. And to keep track of all the delicious meals, I developed a local JSON database with Create, Read, and Delete functionality.

# Ready, Set, Cook!

Getting started with Kids Mealz is as easy as pie. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Once you're in the project directory, run an 'npm install' and then run `npm start` to get the app cooking in development mode. In order to load the JSON file you need to open a second terminal window and run 'json-server --watch db.json'. Simply open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will keep up with you, automatically reloading when you make changes. Any lint errors will be served up in the console.

So, are you ready to make meal planning as easy as ABC? Welcome aboard Kids Mealz! We can't wait to see what you'll cook up.
