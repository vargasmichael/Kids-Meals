# Kids Mealz

This site is for parents to help meal plan for kids. Because kids eat a lot and can sometimes be really picky. 

# Description

In this site you are able to search through the dishes you have added by whatever meal it is or what meal you want to serve your child. You are also able to add meals on another page to be used at a later time. You can also show what meals you have already eaten this week in case you don't want to repeat or to indicate that the child did in fact like that meal. If you no longer are able to make that meal due to lack of ingredients or lack of interest then you can delete the meal with "All Gone" button. 

# Support

If you are in need of finding new dishes to serve to your kids please consult Google or if you are feeling trendy hit up Pinterest. 

# Roadmap

In the future we hope to add an edit feature on the dishes so that if the dish could be a little better with a change then you can alter the ingredients instead of having to enter a whole new dish.
